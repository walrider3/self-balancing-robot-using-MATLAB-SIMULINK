# Two-Sided Self-Balancing Robot Project
## Introduction
Welcome to the Two-Sided Self-Balancing Robot Project repository. This project explores the design and development of a self-balancing robot, diving into control theory, practical implementation, and validation. This README provides an overview of our project.

## Background
Inverted pendulum applications, like self-balancing robots, involve balancing an object with its center of mass above its pivot point. This project applies control theory and Arduino programming to tackle this challenge.

## Purpose
The project's primary aim is to create a self-balancing robot and assess its stability using a manually tuned PID controller. Validation involves comparing real-world results with simulations, ensuring the reliability of our theoretical model.
